### Project Overview
We'll be investigating the access to affordable drinking water. Part 1 of the project is about understanding the data and part 2 is about transforming the data.

### Data Source
- Estimate on the use of water (2020) dataset.

Note that the dataset will not be available here, due to copywrite issues.

### Tools 
- Advanced excel - Understanding and trasforming the data

### Procedure Followed:

#### Part 1: Understaning the data 
- Step 1: **Becoming familiar with the dataset:** We had a look at the different features and definitions of this dataset.
- Step 2: **Importing the data:** In order to investigate the data, we need to import our data, ensuring that it is properly separated into columns and rows.
- Step 3: **Investigating population size:** We had to summarise the national population size to better understand how the dataset represents the entire world population and create new features.
- Step 4: **Investigating access by area:** We had to investigate what access to water at the different service levels looks like for people in specific types of areas (national,urban, and rural)  and create new features.
- Step 5: **Investigating access by population size:** We had to investigate what access to water at the different service levels looks like for different population sizes  and create new features.
- Step 6: **Investigating access by income group:** We want to investigate the relationship between GNI (gross national income) or income group, population size, urbanisation, and national water access  and create new features.

#### Part 2: Transforming the data and creating report called Global 2020 report
- Step 1 and Step 2 are the same as part 1.
- Step 3: **Investigating population size:** A summary of the dataset population size and estimated world population, which includes urban percentage share and the percentage difference between all of the features. A line chart of the national population versus the urban and rural population shares.
- Step 4: **Investigating access by area:** The maximum, minimum, mean, mode, median, first and third quartiles, the interquartile
range, and the standard deviation for each of the 12 water access features. A box and whisker plot for all 12 water access features.
- Step 5: **Investigating access by population size:** Three 100% stacked column charts, one each for national, rural, and urban population size or
percentage versus the four different service levels.
- Step 6:  **Investigating access by income group:** A pivot table for income group versus the sum of the national population and the averages for the urban population, basic, limited, unimproved, and surface access shares. A visualisation (of choice) for income group versus the different average shares in the created pivot table.

### Findings/Results
5 findings from water problem project:

1. In 2020, the world population was estimated to be 7.821 billion, 55% of which lived in urban areas*. The percentage difference between the dataset and the estimated world urban population size (the total number of people living in urban areas) for 2020 is **1.70%**
2. A larger population size lives in urban areas than rural areas in this dataset. Nations are growing, with cities booming while rural areas see a steady decline. This urban shift offers both progress and challenges for the future.
3. Countries with greater urban population shares are more likely to provide basic water services than countries with smaller urban population shares.
4. The significant inequalities in access to basic water in this population. While the national median suggests that most people have access to improved water sources, there are large sections of the population, particularly in rural areas, who lack this basic necessity.
5. The population sizes and shares across the different income groups:
- High-income countries are on average more urbanised than low-, lower-middle-, and upper-middle-income countries.
- More people included in this dataset live in lower-middle-income countries than in any of the other types of economies.
- On average, the greater the income group the more urbanised.

### Recommdations

1. Improve Urban Population Data Accuracy:
-Invest in robust data collection methods: Employ a combination of censuses, surveys, and remote sensing technologies to provide more accurate and granular data on urban populations.
2. Manage Urban Growth:
- Implement policies and programs to improve living conditions and economic opportunities in rural areas, reducing the pressure on urban centers.
3. Ensure Equitable Access to Water:
- Increase investment in water treatment plants, distribution networks, and sanitation facilities, particularly in underserved rural areas.
4. Address Income-Based Disparities:
- Implement policies that foster economic opportunities and improve living standards for all citizens, regardless of income level.
5. Leverage Data for Decision-Making:
- Regularly monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of implemented policies and adjust them as needed based on data-driven insights.
